5	St. Anger and All Nightmare Long are my favorite albums :))
5	Run. Dandududududud
5	SIGN HIM NOW GASE
1	It would probably be horrifying if we tried, when a bug causes an integer overflow and resets our aggression levels. 
5	Apparently Faux news held off on reporting the story at first, presumably until they could get approval on how they should spin it.
5	I like to think it rhymes with wasabi but I have no idea
4	It looks like they do but random redditors do not. What a surprise.

4	This is funny but is it a meme or just a dude‚Äôs cool selfie ?
2	It does look good!
5	> a hug from [NAME] That‚Äôs a bit too big of an ask, fam.

5	They must've been inside a tornado or something, might be what caused the tree to fall behind them.
2	I love that both replies to you are correct. It can be hard to tell cars apart. But also she probably wasn't paying attention.
0	I never said they were emotionless
4	And let me guess, is our friend [NAME] also shilling his own coin that solves all the problems?
5	do you even need to ask of course we need to support her if we dont who the hell will?

2	It‚Äôs not even bad
2	I enjoy fixing problems. I think of it as a task that I can achieve. People get to overworked when they set too unreachable goals.

2	> modern art Modern art lasted from 1860 at the earliest to 1970 at the latest. Thanks for your art critique though, it was very informative.

0	"Oh btw this was me yesterday, commenting on that ""ugly"" ban! "
5	The air can kill you at this temperature.
5	I was pointing out the irony of [NAME] comment.

2	> People who aren‚Äôt stupid don‚Äôt get offended when Called stupid. Exactly. Well put. Thanks.
3	The thought of him having to schedule me in really turns me off and makes me sad. Has the reduced gaming time helped with intimacy in any way?
0	The fuck? That ball was still on the ground tho.
4	I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything sad about how many people are attending from their country, but I am doubtful of their prospects!

4	Crazy how [NAME] being a POS had been factual since the 90s but he‚Äôs only now feeling the consequences of his actions
5	Typical [NAME], i know because i am one
0	Eh, you can't really judge his character solely on the appearances he makes on his GF's IG without making a ton of presumptions
2	What fun is this?? I love it!
2	yes they do, and I am glad that you were able to change hers. 
5	You go home now
5	*sees title* hello there!
2	All i want is to be able to grab pig from an island and let it run freely on my deck

2	This is the guy to talk to! Draftbuffs amazing and getting better constantly.
2	Remember they are an ex for a reason. Seeing that smile probably made you remember all the happy times
5	12. He gets beat up by a total LOSER by the name of [NAME].

2	This is the truest statement I‚Äôve ever read about [NAME]. May he smile mercifully upon you.

2	The ones who agree with her are the only ones who actually address *her* issue....which is how to deal with boundary stomping relatives.
5	It's pretty much a new format now, it must have been TF2 centred. 
1	You mean 0.08 - at 0.8 you'd be dead about twice over
2	Every time there's a video in my sub box I get really excited and then it's Fortnite. It's heartbreaking.
5	just doesnt make sense... almost 30, already played in La Liga and they likely could have had him at any time he was there.
2	I like this idea.
5	I‚Äôm just doing it ironically to own the libs! /s
5	Be prepared for a child support order. But my dad just decided he didn't want to pay any more and the CSEA was ok with that.
0	I am just utterly disgusted by it all
0	Degloved finger...*ouch*. One of the worst types of avulsions.
2	"I think it's hilarious you guys think this will ""help"" [NAME] Yeah [NAME] was bad, but [NAME] didn't show very much either"
0	I apologise for coming off as rude, the end comment was unnecessary and needlessly rude
0	For fuck sake... just go and remind them it's the quiet train!
2	The old ‚ÄúI had sex with your mom‚Äù joke. I chuckled a little.
2	What a good pupper
4	Boy it sure is a hot one today, huh?
2	Hope [NAME] is watching this but he's probably too busy snorting some lines
2	It was a joke long before the meme haha
2	I stand corrected! But, if that's the case, who is the world's second most famous groundhog (assuming [NAME] remains #1)?
0	We don't. That is exclusively a leftist thing, and you know it. 
2	Wow, thanks! Now i am rich again!

2	I reallllly loved the show. It disturbed me a lot, definitely. But I want more now.
5	Instead of dumped underground at a later date, just dumped into the sea earlier. Despicable
2	Even then, the commentor could have gotten the joke and was just being dead pan. 
0	Damn how do you post something directly to the front page?

2	Congratulations on the job interview! NParents seem to give the absolute *worst* job advice. I'm glad that you've figured that out earlier than I did!
5	Imagine [NAME] ever saying this.
2	Pretty sure it‚Äôs a reference to Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúBird Box‚Äù movie. In which case - brutal; I love it.
2	Im actually going to this game! One of the only chances every year I have to see the boys play in person. LET GO DEVILS
5	Over thinking things on both sides.
2	Give her weed to make her asexual and want to have sex with you. Great [NAME] logic.

5	I don't believe no one in your class thought of Mac or iPhone.
3	I feel like the last two seasons made me detach from the show.
2	I really hope not. Personally I have no interest in VR games, and not even my favorite game would change that.
3	Oh my [NAME] I forgot about that movie
2	Wow grats man. Hopefully I can use this inspiration for myself tomorrow. If there was something new you learned in this experience would share it?
5	He should really let [NAME] come inside him
2	Its probably just related to something she is dealing with. Stress/anxiety often causes nightmares. But there are plenty of potential
2	Lol Yes Most people arent 100% either (especially women). For a variety of reasons...finding beauty in other people, curiosity, jealousy, etc...
5	I prefer to pay for my hugs, higher quality.
5	Which is exactly the point capt obvious.
3	I've seen guys who didn't know each other start conversations about sports. It all seemed very effortless.
2	Well I mean Australia is a good example of this working isn‚Äôt it ?

0	No, that's not possible. If you have proof then it's not misinformation what your spreading but simply information. 
2	I‚Äôm very happy for you! Congrats! üòÅ
2	I think there is a reality to that. Some of the focus has shifted to policing the language at the expense of dealing with more fundamental issues.
0	Now you move onto personal insults. Well done O king of the waffles. Once again using a word (nuance) with no context. Bored now.
5	Try to get between us and our maple syrup and see what happens

5	Is that meat or veggies?
0	The fact that [NAME], the other principal in the original story, has gotten out of this unscathed is annoying.
0	AP can tell them to leave, and then call the cops if they don't. Soliciting/begging is not allowed on Target property.

3	Bet Highland Council are sorry they sold their bunker last year.
2	That might be an issue when it comes to meeting girls all the way around. Generally we love a guy who can make us laugh.

2	$20 paywall out $20 'starter pack' in ‚Äî this would be great
