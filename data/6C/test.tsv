4	Girls super-like?
3	Couldn't have happened to a nicer person.

2	Thank you, next! 
2	Going to the doctor tomorrow for a checkup to make sure everything is normal and hopefully this shit is just in my head.
5	you guys got hate in your heart
5	DAE hate unnecessarily salty people like OP?
2	That’s adorable! He probably wants them all in one spot so he can make sure they’re ok and not getting lost or hurt.
2	I think you'll find that dating is really difficult for poly men. It's the biggest reason why I'm monogamous.
2	It’s perfect. You’re perfect. Never change.
5	"""are you related?"" ""No"" ""Are you <more specific type of related>?"""

2	i did, but it was at 3 am before i went to bed, so i’m gonna cheat and count it as 2018 LOL.
5	I find it telling that a very known Russian media uses [NAME] as an exemple....
3	I’m so sorry the internet has inconvenienced you

5	 Now, can you make another applet to change his wallpaper?
2	I did and found it basically the same except I was getting drunk very easily.
5	Weird, though. So many people love to identify themselves by their corporate loyalty.
2	Thanks, I love it.

5	Highgate Hill! Close to westend and has a lot of cute houses. :)
2	Right now I’d have to say [NAME] new restaurant UB Preserve is my favorite place to eat. So good.

2	PLANT LOCAL WILDFLOWERS!!!! They come back year after year and the Pollinators will Love it.
2	Totally agree with you. Just saying that [NAME] is not a stupid person. A smart person that will be spending the rest of his life in prison
0	"You can't post a Sons pic and then say ""I got this"", that just hurts."
2	Yes - thank you for stating it this way - perfectly said.
2	Congrats!!! Happy for you.
5	Pretty sure the legislature needs to change laws
2	Oh dear, I'm so sorry you are going through this. I don't have any sage advice but I hope things get better for you.
2	Yeah this is pretty eye opening. I’ve had pretty weird relationships with my reflection in the past but thankfully it’s not always this way.
2	Nope, from Nebraska why? Lmao

5	[NAME] doesn’t roll his ankle on a 🎾 in 2011 and we win a premiership imo
5	True. Icing all three of your villains for the duration of the film is a bad idea. They need to be making moves.
5	2 more trae assists pls another 3 would be delightful as well
2	So happy for you :)
5	"BT In the commentary booth: ""Where's your god [NAME]?"" As she's being mauled by a lion"
5	It’s a facepalm just for the wrong reason
5	"Because there's such a thing as ""too good to be true"" and some people are still skeptical of that."
5	He seemed like he was about to run away and go do some meth.
3	Don't know how that was missed. Tragic really. Considering the title.
1	I’m just worried about his attitude and approach with younger players. Edit-re worded
2	This is really well put. I saved it.
2	Thank you. ❤️ I really appreciate your comment
2	I've seen so many of these and I still have a massive amount of difficulty believing it is possible.
2	Why so much green though lol
2	Unemployed now re: those crummy health issues. So that probably helped.
2	Sounds fun from what I’m reading on here.
5	"Just wait till they see what British capitalists have in store for them now we got ""arr soverinity"" back"

2	I think most people have listened to bohemian rhapsody at some point thank you very much
5	We didn't screw it up!
4	I wouldn't say age would stop it just lessen the affect of it but probably start to notice it around mid to late 30's.
3	You should be embarrassed. Not only because you are a adulterer but because you are a pedo for thinking of your son.

5	The problem is complex but in the 60's til now we where facing major propaganda against marijuana and this stuck to the head of most poeple.

2	Really good point here. Thanks.
4	Is that bottom trey filled with beer? If so, how did he acquire them?
1	Of course he will lie cheat and steal to make him self relevant to the public. Horrible person.
2	Id rather have them be physically ok and make amends with [NAME] later than have one without the ability to communicate efficiently forever but have their feelings alright.
5	You're cool
5	No problem. If you read it let me know what you think!

5	"""I SAID, [NAME]!"""
0	[NAME] is a hungry little bastard.
4	I had no idea it would hit me as hard as it did. It really changed my view.
5	His best season was a luck filled one. He'd be nothing more than what [NAME] and [NAME] already offer but with worse defense and a worse bat.

2	Same boat here, man.
2	What a baby...
5	Yeah I think it largely depends on how you fall. In Judo that’s one of the main things they practice.
5	And it needs to keep pushing harder and harder to the left in order to wash away all the crap that's been enacted since [NAME] got into office.
5	Actually there were blacks in the SS. Kind of an odd analogy.

0	No way society should pay for your child when you are perfectly capable.
4	Lol he was actually roasting OG fans that lick his arse, not [NAME] himself. Take the upvote.
5	AA is BS as a whole. Meritocracy or GTFO.

2	Awesome, let's celebrate! Send the free pack over here ;)
5	This says more about what [NAME] thinks about facts than what's true about music.
0	And there you have it, the left who argue with personal attacks and cnn buzzwords.
2	His wounds weren’t that bad, but probably got infected. Antibiotics fixed him. Good as new. 
3	Yes of mine worry, no one liked mine either. 
5	This sub absolutely gets personal within seconds of anything he says being postes
1	I’m going to die right now I’m so scared tears and snot everywhere

5	You just watched a commercial that blatantly explains it to you.
5	By law, China must accept the South China Sea ruling, period. Stop trying to help China weasel out of it. 
2	This is something that has to be learned from experience. Don't be hard on yourself!
5	i know the feeling dude
2	> His face, mate. He thought he was a goner. Properly lol'd at that and reading all [NAME]' bits in his accent
3	No because to them this disabled boy is faceless. It’s easier to digest our hate and vitriol without thinking about it.
0	Fucking hell they're bringing on all the giants
0	Weird flex, but ok
0	Definitely fake. Looks like bad CGI in a movie.
5	Or better yet, on the woman who will let ME play with them!

5	Can we all pitch in and buy this place instead of the Baltimore House?
5	Dirt bar downtown is pretty sweet.

5	Indeed. I thought we are just spoiled, but apparently the phenomena is not exlusive to us.
3	Oh my gosh. This woman who died also had a son who died. Holy tragedy
5	And people still support him....
0	I think that's just natural, humans weren't really intended to fly by nature so I guess it just feels wrong or something, idk
2	This isn't really petty, it's actually brutal. *edit* but well done. I love it!
5	It was squirting all over my kitchen n the nurse. Who then said oh nicked an artery.
