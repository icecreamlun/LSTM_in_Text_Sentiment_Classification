10	Super unflattering. [NAME] is not overweight but this ensemble made her appear chunky.
0	Wow that's a really great explanation. Makes sense!
2	Your manager sounds like an idiot. Not saying he/she is. Just sounds like it from this.
7	Do you have any tinder picture or bio advice? I have no selfies or mirror pics but still not doing very well
26	Wow, season 3 is actually out already. Need to check it out
